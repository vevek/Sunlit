## Requirements

To use ForecastIO, all you need is an API key for the [Dark Sky API](https://developer.forecast.io/). ForecastIO supports iOS, OS X, watchOS, and tvOS.

## Installation

ForecastIO is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod "ForecastIO"
```

To integrate using [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage), specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "sxg/ForecastIO"
```

## Documentation & Unit Tests

The full documentation for ForecastIO is available on [CocoaDocs](http://cocoadocs.org/docsets/ForecastIO).

ForecastIO includes a full suite of unit tests with 100% code coverage.

## Usage

First, create an `APIClient` with your API key:

```swift
import ForecastIO
...
let forecastIOClient = APIClient(apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE")
```

You can choose units that you want `Forecast` responses to use:

```swift
forecastIOClient.units = .SI
```

The following units are supported:
- SI
- US (default)
- Canadian
- UK
- Auto (uses the local units for the location for which you are requesting weather data)

With the `APIClient`, you can make two kinds of requests. The first will get the current `Forecast` for a particular location:

```swift
forecastIOClient.getForecast(latitude: myLat, longitude: myLon) { (currentForecast, error) -> Void in
  if let currentForecast = currentForecast {
    //  We got the current forecast!
  } else if let error = error {
    //  Uh-oh we have an error!
  }
}
```

The second kind of request will get a `Forecast` for a particular location at a particular time:

```swift
forecastIOClient.getForecast(latitude: myLat, longitude: myLon, time: myTime) { (forecast, error) -> Void in
  if let forecast = forecast {
    //  We got the forecast!
  } else if let error = error {
    //  Uh-oh we have an error!
  }
}
```

The `Forecast` you receive will have metadata as well as `DataPoint`s and `DataBlock`s associated with it. A `DataPoint` such as the `currently` property on `Forecast` represents various weather phenomena occurring at a specific instant of time. A `DataBlock` such as the `minutely`, `hourly`, and `daily` properties on `Forecast` represent the various weather phenomena occurring over a period of time. `DataBlock`s possess a `data` property, which holds an array of `DataPoint`s.

For a full list of properties defined on all models, consult the [full documentation on CocoaDocs](http://cocoadocs.org/docsets/ForecastIO).
